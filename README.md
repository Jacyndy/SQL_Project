## Process
This project followed the ETL process
Step 1: Creating the database to be used for the project 
Step 2: creating tables for the database and assigning data types to the tables
Step 3: data exploration and cleaning
Step 4: data analysis and more cleaning
Step 5: Performimg the QA processes

## Results
From the data we found that United States generates more revenue and have more visitors to site compared to other countries in the data. 

## Challenges 
One of the challenges faced while using the data, is its lack of defined information about what each table has. There are foreign keys in some tables without a corresponding primary key making it hard to create relationships between. There is also limited information on some of the variables used.

## Future Goals
More data exploration and try to understand the information each column carries. Improving my SQL skills and data analysis process
